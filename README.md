# Pharmacy Application in Java and MySQL Database
Our team in this work will deal with the implementation of a pharmacy application. We will focus on the presentation of Entities, Relationships, Attributes, Plurals, Definition Fields, Relationship Properties and Data Types. In addition, we will create the database and convert it to a relational model. We will present the Entity-Correlation diagram and analyze the function of the data. Furthermore, the database will be connected with a Java application in order to see the results.
